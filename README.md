# Clarity | UI Mock-up 🎨✨

**The Visual Concept for the Text Summarization Feature.**

This repository is dedicated solely to the **visual presentation** of the future Clarity summarization feature. It is a **High-Fidelity Prototype** built using simple frontend code to simulate the look and feel of the finished application.

**⚠️ WARNING: This project is a static design shell. It does not contain any backend logic, API integration, or working summarization functionality. It's a "paint job," not an engine.**

## 🖼️ The Purpose: Design Preview

The goal of this repository is to finalize the user experience (UX) and visual design before integrating it with the complex backend services (Node.js and Python AI).

This prototype demonstrates the planned appearance:
* **The Main Layout:** Placement of the input area and the summarized output.
* **Aesthetic Direction:** The intended color scheme and typography.
* **Future Elements:** Placeholder visuals for the right-hand information panel and planned animations.

## 💡 What You See (Static Elements)

The interaction is purely client-side and simulated:

| Element | Current State | Future State (Goal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | A simple text area for visual balance. | Will accept URLs, raw text, and connect to a validation system. |
| **"Summarize" Button**| Triggers a pre-coded visual change or mock loading state. | Will send a request to the Python AI service. |
| **Output** | Contains static, placeholder text (e.g., "Mock Summary Result"). | Will display real, dynamic text generated by the NLP engine. |
| **Aesthetics** | Basic colors for structure. | Full custom theme, smooth CSS transitions, and micro-animations. |

---

## 💻 Tech Used

This is a pure static frontend representation.

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used only for basic DOM manipulation (e.g., toggling a "loading" state or swapping placeholder text) to simulate interaction.

## ⚡ How to View the Mock-up

Since there is no complex setup, you can view the design instantly:

1.  **Download ZIP**
    exctract zip to any folder on your pc
2.  **Open the file:**
    Simply double-click `index.html` in your file explorer, and it will open in your web browser.

## 🔮 Next Steps

Once the design is approved, this static code will serve as the template for the actual functional frontend, which will be integrated with the **Clarity** backend services.
