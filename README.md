## 🚀 The Vision

The modern web is an overwhelming storm of information. **Clarity** is envisioned as your personal filter and sanctuary.

It will be a **self-hosted web application**, meaning you run it on your own server or local machine. This gives you complete control and 100% privacy. Your data, your focus, your rules.

## 🎯 Core Features (The Plan)

Clarity is being designed around three main pillars of productivity:

* 📰 **Instant Summaries**
    * Tired of 5,000-word articles full of fluff? Paste any URL, and Clarity's AI backend (powered by Python) will distill it into a concise, easy-to-digest summary.

* 🎧 **Focus-Flow Audio**
    * An integrated, minimalist music player with curated soundscapes scientifically designed to help you focus.
    * **Deep Concentration:** Binaural rhythms and minimal electronic.
    * **Light Work:** Chillhop and lofi beats.
    * **Relax:** Ambient sounds and meditative tracks.

* 📚 **The Library & Notes**
    * **Personal Library:** Don't let good ideas vanish. Save any summarized article to your personal, searchable library.
    * **Simple Notes:** A clean, distraction-free notepad is built right in, perfect for capturing fleeting thoughts or expanding on what you've read.

## 🛠️ Our Tech Vision

To bring this vision to life, Clarity will be built on a modern, flexible stack:

* **Frontend:** Simple, clean **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.
* **Backend (Core API):** A fast and reliable **Node.js** server.
* **AI (Summarization):** A powerful **Python** service to handle the natural language processing.
